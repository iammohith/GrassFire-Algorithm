# GrassFire-Algorithm
Grassfire Pathfinding Algorithm Simulation: This project visualizes the Grassfire algorithm for pathfinding in a grid environment. It includes features for displaying the grid, obstacle placement, distance calculations, and the shortest path simulation. Users can interact with the grid and observe the robot's movement toward the goal.
