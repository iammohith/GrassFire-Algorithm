# Grassfire Pathfinding Algorithm Simulation

This project implements the Grassfire Algorithm for pathfinding in a grid-based environment, simulating the movement of a robot from a start cell to a goal cell while avoiding obstacles. The simulation visualizes the grid, the distances calculated by the Grassfire algorithm, and the shortest path found.

## Introduction
This project implements a robot pathfinding simulation using a grid-based approach. It utilizes the Grassfire algorithm to compute distances from a goal cell and visualize the shortest path from a specified start cell to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

## Features
- **Grid Visualization**: Displays a grid with start, goal, and obstacle cells.
- **Distance Calculation**: Implements the Grassfire algorithm to calculate distances from the goal to each cell.
- **Shortest Path Simulation**: Visualizes the robot's movement along the shortest path to the goal.
- **Robot Representation**: The robot is represented as a blue rectangle with wheels and an orange top mount.
- **MATLAB Graphics**: Utilizes MATLABâ€™s graphical capabilities to create an interactive simulation experience.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (preferably R2018b or later)

## Usage
Clone this repository and run the `start_simulation.m` file, providing the grid dimensions, start cell, goal cell, and obstacles as input parameters.

### Parameters
To run the simulation, call the `start_simulation` function with the appropriate parameters:

```matlab
start_simulation(m, n, startCell, goalCell, obstacles)
```

- `m`: Number of rows in the grid.
- `n`: Number of columns in the grid.
- `startCell`: Linear index of the start cell.
- `goalCell`: Linear index of the goal cell.
- `obstacles`: Array of linear indices representing obstacle cells.

### Example
![Problem Statement](Display_Grid.png)
```matlab
m = 5; % Number of rows
n = 5; % Number of columns
startCell = 1; % Start cell index
goalCell = 13; % Goal cell index
obstacles = [7, 8, 12, 14]; % Obstacle cells

start_simulation(m, n, startCell, goalCell, obstacles);
```

## File Structure
The project consists of the following MATLAB functions:
- `start_simulation.m`: The main function that initiates the simulation.
- `display_grid.m`: Displays the grid with the start, goal, and obstacle cells.
- `grassfire_algorithm.m`: Implements the Grassfire algorithm to calculate distances.
- `display_distances.m`: Displays the distances on the grid.
- `shortest_path.m`: Visualizes the robot's path from the start to the goal cell.
- `draw_robot.m`: Draws the robot's representation on the grid.
