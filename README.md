# Grassfire Pathfinding Algorithm Simulation

This project implements the Grassfire Algorithm for pathfinding in a grid-based environment, simulating the movement of a robot from a start cell to a goal cell while avoiding obstacles. The simulation visualizes the grid, the distances calculated by the Grassfire algorithm, and the shortest path found.

## Introduction
This project implements a robot pathfinding simulation using a grid-based approach. It utilizes the Grassfire algorithm to compute distances from a goal cell and visualize the shortest path from a specified start cell to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

## Features
- **Grid Visualization**: Displays a grid with start, goal, and obstacle cells.
- **Distance Calculation**: Implements the Grassfire algorithm to calculate distances from the goal to each cell.
- **Shortest Path Simulation**: Visualizes the robot's movement along the shortest path to the goal.
- **Robot Representation**: The robot is represented as a blue rectangle with wheels and an orange top mount.
- **MATLAB Graphics**: Utilizes MATLABâ€™s graphical capabilities to create an interactive simulation experience.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (preferably R2018b or later)

## Usage
Clone this repository and run the `start_simulation.m` file, providing the grid dimensions, start cell, goal cell, and obstacles as input parameters.

### Parameters
To run the simulation, call the `start_simulation` function with the appropriate parameters:

```matlab
start_simulation(m, n, startCell, goalCell, obstacles)
```

- `m`: Number of rows in the grid.
- `n`: Number of columns in the grid.
- `startCell`: Linear index of the start cell.
- `goalCell`: Linear index of the goal cell.
- `obstacles`: Array of linear indices representing obstacle cells.

### Example
![Problem Statement](Display_Grid.png)
```matlab
m = 5; % Number of rows
n = 5; % Number of columns
startCell = 1; % Start cell index
goalCell = 13; % Goal cell index
obstacles = [7, 8, 12, 14]; % Obstacle cells

start_simulation(m, n, startCell, goalCell, obstacles);
```

## File Structure
The project consists of the following MATLAB functions:

- **`start_simulation.m`**: The main function that initiates the simulation, calling other functions to display the grid, run the Grassfire algorithm, and visualize the robot's path.

- **`display_grid.m`**: Displays the grid with the start cell (in green), goal cell (in red), and obstacles (in black). It ensures proper visualization by dividing the grid into rows and columns.

- **`grassfire_algorithm.m`**: Implements the Grassfire algorithm to calculate the distance of each cell from the goal while considering obstacles. Obstacles are marked as impassable, and distances propagate to the rest of the grid.

- **`display_distances.m`**: Displays the calculated distances from the Grassfire algorithm on the grid.

- **`shortest_path.m`**: Visualizes the shortest path from the start cell to the goal cell based on the Grassfire algorithm's output. It plots the path step-by-step, avoiding obstacles.

- **`draw_robot.m`**: Draws the robot's representation on the grid. The robot features a blue rectangular body, black wheels, and an orange circular mount to distinguish it visually.

- **`index_to_rowcol.m`**: Converts a linear cell index to its corresponding row and column indices in a grid with dimensions `m x n`. Unlike MATLAB's default `ind2sub`, which assumes column-major order, this function works for **row-major order** (left-to-right row-wise).
